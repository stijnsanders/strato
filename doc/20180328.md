# news but not all bad

Being a hobbyist programmer, I only now and then get round to put a little time into stuff of my own. I started on this idea to do iterations differently, and that's not panning out yet. It turns out there's something wrong with this juxtaposition-thing I got going. But not all is lost. I'm still mulling away at using _the `,` operator_ as a _tuple constructor_, and perhaps even use exactly that when parsing argument lists on function calls... And I'm also thinking about this fancy new `=>` operator you hear about here and there. Having a knack of _reduction into the absurd_ I'm considering it as perhaps even the _only_ way to define functions...

But first something about code blocks (`{}`). I was planning to have the last expression of the block, if it isn't closed by a semicolon, also deliver the resulting value for the entire block, but thinking about having reference variables that point to some code to execute, the _real_ value of a code block should be the pointer to the code of that block. But then the type of such a reference would be a signature that never had any arguments. So I guess that's where the `()=>{}` syntax would come in, but I'm not sure yet... And ofcoure there's this scoping nightmare that ensues if the block uses variables declared in the parent code block...

But for now, I guess I'll should first clear my had and make iteration and selection work properly.
