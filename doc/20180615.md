# what if any code block results in a pointer to the code

I haven't been able to do anything more than revise iterations, but I've come to a new realisation while thinking about all of strato. Before, I thought code blocks that don't have a trailing semicolon (`;`) after the last statement, should themselves result in the value from this last expression.

But now, contemplating the difference between _declaration level_ at the root of a source file, and the _imperative level_ in any code block, I think _any_ code block, should in fact return a _pointer_ the the _compiled_ code.

Since we're trying to roll a language without reserved words, I thought about how to do lambda, and have a convenient syntax to define logic for delayed evaluation without a `function` keyword. And less is more, so not why _just_ use `{}`.

And there's more. The _type_ of the returned pointer would be of a signature, either for a _procedure_ without arguments, or a _function_ without arguments that returns the value of the last expression that's missing a trailing `;`.
