# Now here's a funny story

I was thinking, could I use JSON instead of this fancy-pansy data-store I was trying to create, based on all integers and lists and structures all geared to get the best performance out of? I've had a nice 'live JSON object' thingy [up and running for a while now](https://github.com/stijnsanders/jsonDoc#jsondoc). Could I use a set of IJSONDocument references to hold it all, and solve the problem of being able to add all kinds of attributes and flags during optimization stages of this compiler-in-the-works, and have a straight-forward way to serialize to and from files? (And have easier time debugging because human readable.)

I had a quick go at it. Building up a tree of name-spaces with all its elements, OK. But then. `n['type']` can't be just a IJSONDocument reference. A string? An array of strings that _string_ out a fully qualified name, so you can resolve it through the namespaces... every time?!

So, no I don't think JSON is a good fit. There's all kinds of structured data, yes, but having references between elements of the collection is not something that JSON was designed for.

Talking about references. I'm still struggling with the 'early linking', and if or how I should keep 'open' references while parsing to enable some kind of linking stage somewhere later. But then I'd have to give up the _context aware_ parser as it currently stands... Still haven't made my mind up about that one.
